== 0.1.0

* Bugfix
  * Results were looking correct for the total set <tt>User.duplicate(force: true)</tt> and <tt>User.duplicate.copies</tt> but there were no results returned for <tt>User.duplicate.originals</tt>. Re-oriented the direction of the joins to be more straightforward and now the results have been consistent from my tests against data.

* Todo
  * Come up with a less silly name?
